    "4. Explain bisection search. How does it differ from linear search? Give specific estimates in terms of computational complexity of each.\n",
    "5. Explain how function call flow works. What is the difference between a formal and actual parameter? When is a function actually executed? Explain the difference between local and global variables. What is a default value or keyword? What is a docstring? How do I write one?\n",
    "6. Explain the Subset-Sum problem and its solution.\n",
