    "In the middle of the 20th century people were unlocking other methods for determining when humans, chimps and gorillas separated in the tree of life. Instead of using phenotypic expressions to compare organisms people like [Vincent Sarich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Sarich) and Allan Wilson, used a method known as [molecular clocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_clock) to determine evolutionary relationships. What we now know due to efforts by Sarich and others is that:\n",
